''' N teams participate in a league cricket tournament on Mars, where each pair of distinct teams plays each other exactly once. Thus, there are a total of (N Ã— (N-1))/2 matches. An expert has assigned a strength to each team, a positive integer. Strangely, the Martian crowds love one-sided matches and the advertising revenue earned from a match is the absolute value of the difference between the strengths of the two matches. Given the strengths of the N teams, find the total advertising revenue earned from all the matches.


For example, suppose N is 4 and the team strengths for teams 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 3, 10, 3, and 5 respectively. Then the advertising revenues from the 6 matches are as follows:'''

N = input()
strength = input().split(" ")
dummy = 0
count = 0
for i in range(int(N)):
    for j in range(i,int(N)):
        dummy = abs(int(strength[i])-int(strength[j]))
        count += dummy
        dummy = 0
print(count)
